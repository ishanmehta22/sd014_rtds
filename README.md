## 🔭 Overview

The GPU Cost Optimizer is designed to help data scientists, ML engineers, and researchers find the most cost-effective GPU instances across various cloud providers based on their specific workload requirements. By analyzing factors such as model type, dataset size, task type (training or inference), budget constraints, and preferred regions, the application recommends optimal GPU instances with detailed explanations of why each instance is recommended.

## ✨ Features

- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Recommends GPU instances based on comprehensive scoring that considers multiple factors.
- **Multi-Region Support**: Searches for GPU instances across multiple regions (Mumbai, Noida, Atlanta).
- **Task-Aware Optimization**: Optimizes recommendations differently for training vs. inference tasks.
- **Budget Constraints**: Takes into account budget limitations when making recommendations.
- **Spot Instance Savings**: Highlights potential savings from using spot instances.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Provides clear explanations for why each instance is recommended.
- **Server Health Monitoring**: Shows the status of the backend API.
- **Responsive UI**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🏗 Architecture

The application follows a modern client-server architecture:

### Environment Variables

#### Backend Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

```
# Environment (development, production)
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Enable/disable debugging
DEBUG=True

# API Keys for external services (if needed)
ACECLOUD_API_KEY=your_acecloud_api_key_here

# Allowed origins for CORS
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

#### Frontend Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with:

```
# API URL
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Environment
REACT_APP_ENV=development
```

## 📚 API Documentation

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

### `GET /`

Root endpoint to check if the API is running.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "GPU Cost Optimizer API is running"
}
```

### `GET /health`

Health check endpoint.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### `POST /recommendations`

Get GPU instance recommendations based on workload requirements.

**Request Body**:
```json

## 💻 Development

### Backend Development

The backend is built with FastAPI and follows these conventions:

- **app/main.py**: Contains API endpoints and request handling
- **app/recommender.py**: Contains the core recommendation logic and scoring algorithm
- **app/schemas.py**: Contains Pydantic models for data validation

To add new functionality:

1. Define new schemas in `schemas.py` if needed
2. Implement the business logic in `recommender.py`
3. Create new API endpoints in `main.py`

### Frontend Development

The frontend is a React application with the following structure:

- **src/App.js**: Main React component
- **src/api.js**: API client functions
- **src/App.css**: Custom styles

To extend the frontend:

1. Add new components in the `src` directory
2. Update API client functions in `api.js` if needed
3. Add new styles in `App.css`

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Testing

Run backend tests using pytest:

```bash
# From the backend directory
pytest
```

### Frontend Testing

Run frontend tests using Jest:

```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm test
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Backend Deployment

The backend can be deployed as a Docker container or directly to a cloud provider:

#### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t gpu-cost-optimizer-api ./backend

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 gpu-cost-optimizer-api
```

#### Direct Deployment

For deploying to platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Google Cloud Run, follow the specific platform's instructions for deploying FastAPI applications.

### Frontend Deployment

Build the frontend for production:

```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` directory with static assets that can be served by any web server or static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3.
